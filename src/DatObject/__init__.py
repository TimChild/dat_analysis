"""This Package contains my main Dat object class and all of the attributes that are associated
with it. Should be built using a builder from DatBuilders (i.e. to build the DatHDF initially). And
then the Dat should be initialized with a DatLoader (which shouldn't have to do much, but may be
important for maintaining backwards compatibility)"""
