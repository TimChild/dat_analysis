# Example folder for Experiment Data
I.e. the .h5 files that are saved from IgorAcq

The data in here is never altered by `dat_analysis`. 

To avoid accidentally modifying this data, when `dat_analysis` opens an experiment `.h5` file for the first time, it creates a standardized copy of it in another location (here `anlayzed_dats`). 

By "standardized", I mean that the format of the `.h5` file created by `dat_analysis` is quite different to the `.h5` files generated by IgorAcq, and should always be the same even if the experiment `.h5` files have changed format due to changes in IgorAcq.
